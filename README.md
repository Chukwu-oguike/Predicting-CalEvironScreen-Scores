# Predicting-CalEvironScreen-Scores



In this project, I will be working with the [California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool (CalEnviroScreen)](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30), which uses demographic and environmental information to identify communities that are susceptible to various types of pollution. The variables in this dataset contribute to the CES score, which reflects a community's environmental conditions and its vulnerability to environmental pollutants. I will be using decision tree methods to predict the CES scores of different census tracts in the state of California.
